## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git.
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-folder-name>
````

### 2\. Create a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

  * **On macOS/Linux:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
  * **On Windows:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

### 3\. Install Dependencies

Create a file named `requirements.txt` and paste the following content into it:

```txt
streamlit
pandas
numpy
plotly
requests
Pillow
google-generativeai
python-dotenv
```

Now, install all the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4\. Set Up Environment Variables (API Key)

This project uses a `.env` file to securely manage your Gemini API key.

1.  Create a new file named `.env` in the root of your project directory.
2.  **Get your Gemini API Key:**
      * Go to the [**Google AI Studio**](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
      * Click on "**Create API key**" and copy the generated key.
3.  Add the key to your `.env` file in the following format:
    ```
    API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

## üç™ Get Your Instagram Cookies

This is the most crucial step. The `sessionid` cookie acts as a temporary password, allowing the script to view Instagram as if it were you.

> **Important Note:** You must use the `sessionid` from an Instagram account that has permission to view the profile you want to analyze. For example, to analyze a **private profile**, you must be logged into an account that **follows** that private profile.

1.  Open your web browser (like Chrome or Firefox) and log in to [**Instagram.com**](https://www.instagram.com).
2.  After logging in, open the **Developer Tools**. You can do this by pressing **F12** or right-clicking on the page and selecting "**Inspect**".
3.  Go to the **Application** tab (in Chrome) or **Storage** tab (in Firefox).
4.  On the left-hand side, find the "**Cookies**" section and select `https://www.instagram.com`.
5.  Find the cookie named `sessionid`. Copy its entire **value**.
6.  You will paste this value into the app's sidebar when you run it.

## üíª How to Run the App

Once you have completed all the setup steps, you can run the Streamlit app with a single command:

```bash
streamlit run your_script_name.py
```

After running the command, your web browser will open a new tab with the dashboard.

1.  **Paste your Instagram `sessionid` cookie** into the text area in the sidebar.
2.  **Enter the Instagram username** you want to analyze.
3.  Click the "**üöÄ Analyze Profile**" button and watch the magic happen\!
